I am a Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
advised by Prof. [Michael G. Hudgens](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/michael-hudgens-phd/) and [Donglin Zeng](https://www.bios.unc.edu/~dzeng/).
My research interest lies in Causal inference, Network (clustered) data, Precision medicine, Statistical machine learning, and Semiparametric efficiency theory.

Through years of education at Seoul National University (B.S. in Statistics and Mathematics) and experience at [Causal Inference Research Lab (UNC)](https://causal.unc.edu) and [Center for AIDS Research (UNC)](http://unccfar.org/portfolio/biostatistics/), I became proficient in statistical data analysis, designing and training machine learning and deep learning models using various software including R, SAS and Python, and grant writing.

I also have experience in statistical genetics, 
participating in the Korean national project (Bio-synergy) at [Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (BIBS) Lab (Seoul National University)](http://bibs.snu.ac.kr), and working as a research assistant at [Yun Li Statistical Genetics Group (UNC)](https://yunliweb.its.unc.edu).
