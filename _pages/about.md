I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
advised by Profs. [Michael G. Hudgens](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/michael-hudgens-phd/) and [Donglin Zeng](https://www.bios.unc.edu/~dzeng/). 
My research interests lie in causal inference, network (clustered) data, precision medicine, statistical machine learning, and semiparametric efficiency theory.

From years of education at Seoul National University (B.S. in Statistics and Mathematics) and my experience at the [Causal Inference Research Lab (UNC)](https://causal.unc.edu) and [Center for AIDS Research (UNC)](http://unccfar.org/portfolio/biostatistics/), I became proficient in statistical data analysis, designing and training machine learning, grant writing, and deep learning models using various software including R, SAS and Python.

I also have experience in statistical genetics. 
I participated in the Korean national project (Bio-synergy) at [Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (BIBS) Lab (Seoul National University)](http://bibs.snu.ac.kr),
and I worked as a graduate research assistant in the [Yun Li Statistical Genetics Group (UNC)](https://yunliweb.its.unc.edu)https://yunliweb.its.unc.edu.
